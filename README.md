# TensorFlow-Speech-CMD-Recognition

In this project several models were aplied to the Speech CMD kaggle dataset , in order to perform speech recognition . A self made spectrogram function was tested (without window overlaping) in order to understand the data transformation aplied to audio data . The best model performed an acuracty of 78% , and consited of a regularized LSTM model. 

This is part of the ANID FONDECYT INICIACION N°11230679 research project in AI Hardware and Neuromorphic Computing.
